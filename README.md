1)Load and configure the Boston Housing Datase
2)Checking the relation between the variables using Pairplot and Correlation Graph
3)Descriptive Statistics - Central Tendency and Dispersion
4)Select the required columns
5)Train Test Split
6)Normalize Data
7)Build the Input Pipeline for TensorFlow model
8)Model Training
9)Predictions
